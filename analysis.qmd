This comes from the file `analysis.qmd`.

We describe here our detailed data analysis. This page will provide an overview of what questions you addressed, illustrations of relevant aspects of the data with tables and figures, and a statistical model that attempts to answer part of the question. You'll also reflect on next steps and further analysis.

The audience for this page is someone like your class mates, so you can expect that they have some level of statistical and quantitative sophistication and understand ideas like linear and logistic regression, coefficients, confidence intervals, overfitting, etc. 

While the exact number of figures and tables will vary and depend on your analysis, you should target around 5 to 6. An overly long analysis could lead to losing points.
If you want you can link back to your blog posts or create separate pages with more details.

The style of this paper should aim to be that of an academic paper. 
I don't expect this to be of publication quality but you should keep that aim in mind.
Avoid using "we" too frequently, for example "We also found that ...". Describe your methodology and your findings but don't describe your whole process.

You don't have to link to every StackOverflow post you used but if there are explainers on aspects of the data or specific models that you found helpful, try to link to those. Also, try to link to other sources that might support (or refute) your analysis. These can just be regular hyperlinks. You don't need a formal citation.

## Rubric: On this page

You will

-   Introduce what motivates your Data Analysis (DA)
    -   Which variables and relationships are you most interested in?
    -   What questions are you interested in answering?
    -   Provide context for the rest of the page. This will include figures/tables that illustrate aspects of the data of your question.
-   Modeling and Inference
    -   The page will include some kind of formal statistical model. This could be a linear regression, logistic regression, or another modeling framework.
    -   Explain the ideas and techniques you used to choose the predictors for your model. (Think about including interaction terms and other transformations of your variables.)
    -   Describe the results of your modelling and make sure to give a sense of the uncertainty in your estimates and conclusions.
-   Explain the flaws and limitations of your analysis
    -   Are there some assumptions that you needed to make that might not hold? Is there other data that would help to answer your questions?
-   Clarity Figures
    -   Are your figures/tables/results easy to read, informative, without problems like overplotting, hard-to-read labels, etc?
    -   Each figure should provide a key insight. Too many figures or other data summaries can detract from this. (While not a hard limit, around 5 total figures is probably a good target.)
    -   Default `lm` output and plots are typically not acceptable.
-   Clarity of Explanations
    -   How well do you explain each figure/result?
    -   Do you provide interpretations that suggest further analysis or explanations for observed phenomenon?
-   Organization and cleanliness.
    -   Make sure to remove excessive warnings, hide most or all code, organize with sections or multiple pages, use bullets, etc.
    -   This page should be self-contained, i.e. provide a description of the relevant data.
    
    
    
# What Motivated Our Data Analysis:
Crime is a pervasive issue that affects communities differently based on various socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic factors. Understanding what drives crime frequency is crucial for developing effective policies and interventions to promote equity and public safety.

Our data analysis was motivated by the desire to uncover relationships between crime and the following key factors:

**Economic Status** (e.g., median income) \
**Demographics** (e.g., racial composition) \
**Location** (e.g., neighborhood characteristics) \
\



# Variables of Interest

The primary variables we analyzed included:

**Crime Frequency:** The total number of reported crimes in a neighborhood. \
**Economic Data:** Median household income from the American Community Survey (ACS). \
**Neighborhood Boundaries:** Spatial boundaries defined by the LA Times. \
**Location Data:** Geospatial coordinates (latitude and longitude) for reported crime incidents. \
#Add to here as necessary \
To explore these variables, we integrated datasets from LAPD crime reports, U.S. Census economic data, and geospatial shapefiles for Los Angeles neighborhoods. This allowed us to analyze both spatial and statistical relationships. \
#Add links here

# Key Questions
**Economic Status and Crime:** Does a neighborhood's median income influence the number of crimes reported? \
**Geographic Crime Hotspots:** Are there specific areas with persistently high crime rates? \
**Disparities in Crime Impact:** How do demographic or socioeconomic disparities correlate with crime?
#Add here as necessary \

# Modeling Economic Data
For a specific statistic model when looking at the economic data in relation to crime, we used a negative binomial relaationship. Initially, we were recommended to utilize a poisson distribution but because there was a statistically significant difference between mean and variance. So, we felt as if a negative binomial was fitting for this problem. 

```{r Negative Binomial}
#| echo: false
library(MASS)
nb_model <- glm.nb(total_crimes ~ avg_income, data = crime_summary_lapd)
summary(nb_model)
```



## 1. Coefficients

### Intercept:
- **Estimate**: 1.924 \
- **Exponentiated**: ~ 6.85 \
  - This means that when the median income is zero (a hypothetical reference), the expected number of crimes is about 6.85 crimes per area.

### Avg_Income Coefficient:
- **Estimate**: -4.169 \times 10^{-6}
- **Exponentiated**: ~0.9999958 \
  - For every $1 increase in median income, the expected crime count decreases by approximately \(0.00042\%\).  
  - For a more interpretable unit, for every $10,000 increase in median income, the expected crime count decreases by approximately 4.2\%.

### Significance:
- **z-value**: -9.977
- **p-value**: p < 2 \times 10^{-16} 
  - The negative relationship between income and crime is highly statistically significant.

---

## 2. Model Fit

### Null Deviance:
- **Value**: 2336.5
  - This represents the deviance of a null model with no predictors.

### Residual Deviance:
- **Value**: 2233.8
  - The reduction from the null deviance indicates an improvement in model fit.

---

## 3. Dispersion Parameter :
- **Value** = 2.2887, with a standard error of 0.0926.
  - A higher value indicates better accommodation of variance in the data. (This was previously tested using Poisson distributed prior and this was a lower theta-value)


```{r Neg Bin Chart}
#| echo: false
crime_summary_lapd <- crime_summary_lapd %>%
  mutate(fitted_crimes_nb = predict(nb_model, type = "response"))

ggplot(crime_summary_lapd, aes(x = avg_income, y = total_crimes)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_line(aes(y = fitted_crimes_nb), color = "blue") +
  labs(
    title = "Negative Binomial Regression: Crime vs. Median Income",
    x = "Median Income",
    y = "Total Crimes"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
The chart shown supports the summary above where we said that as median income increases, crime numbers seem to decrease. Even though it isn't by much, it does trend slightly downward. 


## 4. Coefficient Estimates and Their Standard Errors
**Standard Error (SE):** Measures the variability of each coefficient estimate. Smaller SE indicates more precise estimates. For example:

The SE for the intercept is *0.03495*.
The SE for the median income coefficient is 4.179 \times 10^{-7}.

## 5. Confidence Intervals
Calculated as:


Estimate: 1.96 * Standard Error \


- For the **avg_income coefficient**:
  \[
  -4.169 * 10^{-6},  1.96 * 4.179 * 10^{-7}
  \]
  - Confidence Interval: [-4.42 * 10^{-6}, -3.91 * 10^{-6}]

- **Interpretation**: The true effect of median income on crime likely lies within this range. It reinforces the negative relationship but highlights uncertainty in its exact magnitude.
