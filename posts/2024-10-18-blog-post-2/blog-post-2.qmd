Decided on the dataset of LAPD crime data. We decided that we would look at 2500 from each year (2020-2024) 
[could be subject to change depending on initial analysis], for a total of 12,500 rows. I used a seperate R project to reduce the amount of rows in the csv file and then saved the file as rds file. Here is the following code:

data$year <- format(as.Date(data$DATE.OCC, format = "%m/%d/%Y"), "%Y")
data$year <- as.numeric(data$year)  # Convert year to numeric

# Filter for the years 2020-2024
filtered_years <- data %>%
  filter(year %in% 2020:2024)

# Split by year and sample up to 2500 rows for each year
sampled_data <- filtered_years %>%
  group_split(year) %>%
  map_df(~ slice_sample(.x, n = min(2500, nrow(.x))))

# View the sampled data
head(sampled_data)

saveRDS(sampled_data, "filtered_data.rds")



I then imported this file to the data final project so that groupmates are able to access it.
